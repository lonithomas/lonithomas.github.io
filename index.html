              I need to write a paragraph but I'm not exactly sure what. I'll introduce myself here as there's no directions for the about me page. I am a sophomore at Gonzaga university majoring in marketing and minoring in sports management. I want to work in sports marketing when I'm older.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I'm being honest, I'd much rather work in marketing for music like working at Spotify or for a record label like Columbia or Fueled by Ramen. But that sounds like connections I can't nor don't know how to make and I also don't want to have to live in New York or LA so I've settled. 
            </p>
           <p>
            Outside of school I like to rock climb, make food, hangout with my friends, and watch tv shows.

            <br>Last summer, I attended the Eras Tour. I wanted to be able to listen to a live version of the show on spotify so, when the Eras Tour Movie came out I downloaded it and cut it into seperate audio files for each song.
            One of my favorite songs she performed is <i>"Tolerate It"</i>. It's from her ninth studio album <i>Evermore</i>.
